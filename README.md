# Simple Traffic Light

Another simple project, this one was kinda harder for me to do because I decided to sort of use another programming paradigm using a library as aid (aka Event-based programming).



The program is your typical traffic lights, but you can change the state of it using a push button. This can be ON, halting the traffic light, and turning it OFF. Literally nothing special

## Update:

For the Digital Electronics lab course I've been taking me and other two classmates made this very circuit but instead of using an arduino, we used logic gates on logisim and then using some bcds, adders and whatnot. I'll push those things after I finish some documentation on some other course I'm taking.

# Simple Traffic Light

Another simple project, this one was kinda harder for me to do because I decided to sort of use another programming paradigm using a library as aid (aka Event-based programming).



The program is your typical traffic lights, but you can change the state of it using a push button. This can be ON, halting the traffic light, and turning it OFF. Literally nothing special
